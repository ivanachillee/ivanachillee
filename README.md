<h1>Hey there 👋</h1>

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m Ivan, a data scientist and software developer based in Dublin<sup>(*)</sup>. I am currently thinking new innovative ideas that allow me to intersect all of my different types of knowledge to create astounding projects, so if you see it a little empty, that’s why!<br>

⚡ I’m currently working on [Social Perception: Shaping the spectrum of human thought.](https://github.com/ivanachillee/social-perception)<br>
💬 Ask me about... everything!

<br>

```python
while thing.Status != 'Greatest':
  thing.MakeItGreater()
```
