<h1>Hey there 👋 ‏‏‎Take a seat.</h1>

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m Ivan, a Data Scientist and Software Developer based in Dublin<sup>(*)</sup>. I am currently thinking new innovative ideas that allow me to intersect all of my different types of knowledge to create astounding projects, so if you see it a little empty, that’s why!<br>

🔮 I’m currently working on [Starbucks Marketing: Producing an intelligent ML-powered marketing campaign.](https://github.com/ivanachillee/starbucks-marketing)<br>
💬 Ask me about... everything!

```python
#The Magnificence Loop
while thing.Status != 'Greatest':
  thing.MakeItGreater()
```
